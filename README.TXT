>> i am working on a manual on all the tricks used
   in the making of Owl. I bet it'll teach you the
   Win32 API in the most interesting way.
      
>> due to some deadline pressure and no intention 
   of self hosting and some laziness, OZ sources 
   posted here are incomplete. OZ works perfectly
   but with the following expected but yet
   unimplemented features(all of the following are, 
   thus, todos):
   
   o As whatismyip.com and other sites become 
     more and more script based, we can't figure
     out what our external IP address is. yelp help.
   
   o Sending mail to an smtp server like the one
     here on plox is staightforward. But I'm working
     hard on this TLS thing to get OZ mail to gmail
     accounts which can be #defined at compile time.
     I can use nearly any kind of help on this issue.
     Do drop me an email if you think you can help.
     
   o melting or self-deletion at first run is rocky.
     The de-install, in turn, which uses similar logic,
     is perfect.
     
>> a lot of source code is actually borrowed from
   already published articles/books/sources. 
   I tried to credit the authors wherever possible.
   If you feel I missed someone who should be credited,
   drop me an email, and I'd be glad to credit him/her.
   
>> scan the sources, and if you have any suggestions or
   improvements with or without implementations, please
   email me.
   
>> i whole heartedly welcome any comments ( or compliments)
   from any one.
